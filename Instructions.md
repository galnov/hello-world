# Instructions

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- GitHub's Hello World tutorial

## Lesson 1
1. Create a team branch named "team-<id>" with a unique id
2. Add a team logo (1000x1000 pixels) to the team's branch
3. Each team member creates his own branch from the team's branch
4. Each team member adds his details to Ex1.md (team-id field should contain the team id, duh...)
5. Each team member merges his changes to team branch, after all conflicts are resolved
6. Team merges all its members' changes to the main branch, after all conflicts are resolved

## Lesson 2
1. Each team member runs Draw_Me_A_Sheep.ipynb to create three 256x256 mugshots of a person expressing a feeling: positive (happy, energized) / negative (sad, depressed) 
2. All images are added to a common dataset on Google Drive (or Kaggle)
3. Train a network that will classify each image to positive / negative
